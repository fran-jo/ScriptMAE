- Script for importing data importData
* User provides reference file, and data is stored into internal database format, .h5
** User is allow to choose which data to import

* Validation is applied to reference signals vs simulation signals, being reference signals from 
either other simulation tools or measurements
** The script allows the user to choose between sources (but the user must know the sources, since 
user provide the reference and simulation files)
